A cancellation is a request by the placer for the filler, or the filler to the placer, not to do a previously ordered service. Confirmation of the cancellation request is provided by the filler or placer, e.g., a message with an ORC-1-order control value of CR.
Typical responses include, but are not limited to, CR – Cancelled as requested, UC – Unable to Cancel.</TD>

<TD class=table>Filler Applications.
The combined result code provides a mechanism to transmit results that are associated with two or more orders. This situation occurs commonly in radiology reports when the radiologist dictates a single report for two or more exams represented as two or more orders. For example, knee and hand films for a rheumatoid arthritis patient might generate a single dictation on the part of the radiologist.
When such results are reported the CN code replaces the RE code in all but the last ORC, and the results follow the last ORC and its OBR. An example follows of a single report following three ORCs:
MSH|...<cr>

<TD class=table>Placer Applications.
There are three circumstances that involve requesting an order number (ORC-2-placer order number or ORC-3-filler order number): 

(1) When the filler application needs to request an ORC-3-filler order number from a centralized application (e.g., HIS).
SN – The send order number code provides a mechanism for the filler to request an ORC-3-filler order number from some centralized application (called “other” in the table below), such as a central HIS, by sending an ORM message containing an ORC-1-order control value of SN. This ORC has a null ORC-3-filler order number and an ORC-2-placer order number created by the filler application when the filler originates the order.

The order (SN type) message can be acknowledged by either one of two methods:
a) By an order application acknowledgement message containing an ORC-1-order control value of OK. Then an unsolicited order message can be sent at a future time, containing an ORC with ORC-1-order control value of NA to provide the actual number assigned.

b) By an order acknowledgement message containing an ORC-1-order control value of NA as described below.

NA – The number assigned code allows the “other” application to notify the filler application of the newly-assigned filler order number. ORC-1-order control contains value of NA, ORC-2-placer order number (from the ORC with the SN value), and the newly-assigned filler order number. 
Code	From	ORC-2-Placer Order Number	ORC-3-Filler Order Number
SN	filler application	placer order number^filler application ID	Null
NA	other application	placer order number^filler application ID	filler order number^filler application ID
Note: Both the placer order number and the filler order number have the filler’s application ID

(2) When the filler application needs to request an ORC-2-placer order number from some other application (e.g., Order Entry).

SN – The send order number code provides a mechanism for the filler application to request an ORC-2-placer order number from another application (called “other” in the table below) by sending an order message containing an ORC-1-order control value of SN. This ORC has a null ORC-2-placer order number and an ORC-3-filler order number created by the filler application when the filler originates the order. 

The order (SN type) message can be acknowledged by two methods:
a) By an order application acknowledgement message containing an ORC-1-order control value of OK. Then an unsolicited order message can be sent at a future time, containing an ORC-1-order control value of NA to provide the actual number assigned.
 
b) By an order acknowledgement message containing an ORC-1-order control value of NA as described below.
NA – The number assigned code allows the “other” application to notify the filler application of the newly-assigned ORC-2-placer order number. The ORC contains an ORC-1-order control value of NA, the newly-assigned ORC-2-placer order number, and the ORC-3-filler order number (from the ORC with the SN value).
Code	From	ORC-2-Placer Order Number	ORC-3-Filler Order Number
SN	filler application	null	filler order number^filler application ID
NA	other application	placer order number^placer application ID	filler order number^filler application ID
Note: The new ORC-2-placer order number has the placer’s application ID

(3) When an application (not the filler application) wants to assign an ORC-3-filler order number for a new order.
NW – When the application creating an order (not the filler application) wants to assign a filler order number for a new order.
or 
RO – (RO following an RP). In this case, the “other” application completes ORC-3-filler order number, using the filler application ID as the second component of the filler order number.
Code	From	ORC-2-Placer Order Number	ORC-3-Filler Order Number

These order control codes are used to communicate an order between systems where the order is intended for informational purposes. For example, an order that will be performed by a vendor outside the enterprise of communicating systems. The communicating systems may need to maintain information relative to the order for clinical continuity, but no actions to perform the ordered service are intended.
OP represents an informational version of NW, PY represents the informational-only version of RO. NW and RO table notes also apply to OP and PY, respectively.</TD>

<TD class=table>Hauptauftrag</TD>
<TD class=table>Filler Applications.
The parent (PA) and child (CH) order control codes allow the spawning of “child” orders from a “parent” order without changing the parent (original order). One or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of PA are followed by one or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of CH. Whether OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag. 

For example, suppose that a microbiology culture produced two organisms and corresponding susceptibility reports. Then the sequence of segments would be as follows: (see figure 4-4)

The assignment of placer order numbers in the parent-child paradigm depends on whether the placer or filler creates the child order and in the latter case, on whether the placer supports the SN/NA transaction. If the placer creates the child orders it will assign their placer order numbers according to its usual procedures. If the filler creates the child orders there are two possibilities: each child will inherit the placer order number of its parent, or the filler will use the SN/NA transaction to request that the placer assign a placer order number. In either case, the filler application creates the filler order numbers of the children according to its usual procedures.

Whenever a child order is transmitted in a message the ORC segment’s ORC-8-parent is valued with the parent’s filler order number (if originating from the filler) and with the parent’s placer order number (if originating from the filler or if originating from the placer). 

The parent child mechanism can be used to “expand” a parent order (e.g., an order for three EKGs on successive mornings).</TD>

At least two main use cases require that the complete results of the previous observations be transmitted with the order. 

•	Diagnostic laboratories referring tests to another lab for either confirmation of results (HIV, etc.) or due to not being equipped to do the tests (genetic testing, etc.). 

•	Diagnostic laboratories sending test results to Knowledge Bases for the automated generation of diagnostic comments for inclusion into the lab report.</TD>

<TD class=table>Placer or Filler Applications.
The observations-to-follow code is used to transmit patient-specific information with an order. An order detail segment (e.g., OBR) can be followed by one or more observation segments (OBX). Any observation that can be transmitted in an ORU message can be transmitted with this mechanism. When results are transmitted with an order, the results should immediately follow the order or orders that they support.

The following example shows the sequence of segments for three Pharmacy orders. It illustrates the use of the RE code:
Segment	Order Control	Comment
MSH		
PID		
ORC	NW	First new order
RXO		First order segment
		
ORC	NW	2nd new order
RXO		2nd order segment
[ORC	RE	Patient-specific observation, optional in V 2.2
 OBR]		Observation OBR, optional in V 2.2
OBX		An observation segment
OBX		Another observation segment
OBX		Another observation segment
OBX		Another observation segment
		
ORC	NW	3rd order
RXO		3rd order segment

In this version of HL7, results can be transmitted with an order as one or more OBX segments without the necessity of including the ORC and OBR segments.

Observations can be transmitted in an ORU message without using an ORC. There are times when it is necessary to transmit information not included in the OBR segments of the ORU message. In this case, it is recommended that the ORC be included in the ORU message.

The order control value of RE is required only in ORM messages to indicate that an order is followed by observation results (OBX). The RE code is not necessary in the ORU message because it is expected that the OBR segments can be followed by observation results (OBX).</TD>

Typical responses include, but are not limited to: For a Filler request AF – Order/service refill request approval, DF – Order/service refill request denied; for a Placer request RE – Observations/Performed Service to follow, UF – Unable to refill.</TD>

A replacement is the substitution of one or more orders for one or more previously ordered services.

The replaced orders are treated as though they were canceled. If and when an ordered service can be replaced are local site-specific determinations.

Use the parent/child order control codes if the site specifies that the original order must remain intact. Do not use the replacement codes under this circumstance. 

For each order to be replaced, use an ORC-1-order control value of RP (request for a replacement going to a filler) or RU (an unsolicited replacement created by the filler) used by the filler to notify the placer and/or other systems). By local agreement, the ORC segment (with RP or RU) may be followed by its original order detail segment. The ORC segments (with RP or RU) must be followed by an ORC segment with an ORC-1-order control value of RO (indicating the replacement order). By local agreement, the ORC with the RO value may be followed by an order detail segment. 

For example, suppose that an ancillary application were replacing two OBR orders with three different orders. The sequence of segments would be as follows:

Seg	Order Control	Comment
ORC	RU	1st replaced ORC
OBR		1st replaced order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RU	2nd replaced ORC
OBR		2nd replaced order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RO	1st replacement ORC
OBR		1st replacement order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RO	2nd replacement ORC
OBR		2nd replacement order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RO	3rd replacement ORC
OBR		3rd replacement order’s detail segment

Whether the OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag.

The described replacement method will handle all possible cases of replacement: one into one, many into one, one into many, and many into many. If the placer sent this request to the filler with two RPs, and this was a response back from the filler to the placer, the two RUs (replaced unsolicited) would be two RQs (replaced as requested). (see figure 4-3)

Seg	Order Control	Comment
ORC	RQ	1st replaced ORC
OBR		1st replaced order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RQ	2nd replaced ORC
OBR		2nd replaced order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RO	1st replacement ORC
OBR		1st replacement order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RO	2nd replacement ORC
OBR		2nd replacement order’s detail segment
		
ORC	RO	3rd replacement ORC
OBR		3rd replacement order’s detail segment

The replacement order code is sent by the filler application to another application indicating the exact replacement ordered service. It is used with the RP and RU order control codes as described above.

The rules for the order numbers in ORC segments with an order control value of RO are determined by the replacement type (RP or RU).

In the case of the RU type (i.e., unsolicited replacement by the filler), the filler order number is generated as usual by the filler application. The placer order number is identical to the placer order number of the first transmitted ORC with an order control value of RU.

In the case of the RP type (i.e., a replacement request from another application to the filler), the placer order number is generated by the placer application using the procedure for new orders. The filler order number is generated by the filler application using the procedure identical for new orders.

If a replacement sequence is used in an ORU message (i.e., during results reporting), the following are the recommended segments to be used for the replacement orders:

ORC with an order control value of RO.

Any OBR segments (can be replaced by any order detail segments).

Optionally followed by observation result segments (OBX)
NTE segments can appear after the OBR (or any order detail segment) or after an OBX segment as in a regular ORU message.</TD>

An unable to accept code is used when a new order cannot be accepted by the filler. Possible reasons include requesting a prescription for a drug which the patient is allergic to or for an order which requires certain equipment resources which are not available such that the order cannot be filled. Note that this is different from the communication level acceptance as defined within the MSA segment.</TD>

An unable-to-cancel code is used when the ordered service is at a point that it cannot be canceled by the placer or filler or when local rules prevent cancellation by the filler. The use of this code is dependent on the value of ORC-6-response flag.
If the filler initiated the request to cancel and the placer is unable to cancel while the filler cannot proceed with the fulfillment of that order, then the necessary communication to resolve the conflict is outside the scope of these messages.</TD>
