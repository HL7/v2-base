<A NAME="Heading2">1.1  PURPOSE </A></h2>

<p><br>
This document contains the specifications for version 2.2 of the Health Level
Seven (HL7) Standard for electronic data exchange in healthcare environments,
with special emphasis on inpatient acute care facilities (i.e., hospitals).  It
summarizes the work of a committee of healthcare providers (users), vendors and
consultants established in March 1987 on the occasion of a conference hosted by
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.  Its participants, who
represent users as well as vendors, share a common goal of simplifying the
implementation of interfaces between computer applications from different, and
often competing, vendors.  This committee, which subsequently became known as
the HL7 Working Group, endeavors to standardize the format and protocol for the
exchange of certain key sets of data among healthcare computer application
systems.  Meetings are held approximately every four months in scattered
locations throughout the United States.  HL7 sanctioned national groups also
exist in many other countries outside of the United States including Australia,
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.<br>
This document is being presented to interested parties.  It is a status report
that is published to solicit the involvement of the broadest possible group of
participants as this protocol is being put into use.  Comments are solicited on
all aspects of the Standard.<br>
This effort is expected to yield a voluntary, ad hoc standard that is open to
<b>all</b> who develop healthcare data processing systems.  As the Standard has
been put into production, experience has been gained and is reflected in this
latest revision.<br>
There have been two parallel efforts over the last three years since the last
Standard publication (version 2.1).  First, version 2.2 represents an
evolutionary change over version 2.1 that was published in 1990.  Version 2.2
is the result of more than three years work, and thousands of hours of effort
by members of all three communities since the publication of version 2.1 in
June 1990.   Its primary goals include maintaining backwards compatibility with
version 2.1, correcting errors discovered after the publication of 2.1, and
extending the Standard within the format and context of version 2.1.<br>
Also, within the last three years, HL7 has adopted new formal by-laws and
voting procedures.  These procedures are modeled on the balloting procedures of
other relevant healthcare industry computer messaging standards organizations
(e.g., ASTM) and are designed to conform to the requirements of the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI).  In June 1994, HL7 became an ANSI
Accreditied Standards Organization.  HL7 is participating in ANSI's Health
Information Standards Planning Panel (HISPP) as well.<br>
HL7 as an organization, has experienced significant growth over the last three
years.  Currently, HL7 has almost 1300 members in all membership categories and
regularly attracts 250-300 members and non-members to each of its three yearly
meetings.  As of mid-1993, HL7 had documented over 170 healthcare provider
organizations that have implemented computer interfaces based on the HL7
Standard.  As of December 1994, HL7 estimates that over 1,000 undocumented
implementations exist in both the United States and in other countries.  It is
possible for a healthcare provider institution to use HL7 without actually
being an HL7 member through a member vendor or through outright purchase of the
Standard without joining HL7.</p>
<h2>
</h2>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">1.2  BACKGROUND </A></h2>

<p><br>
The term "Level 7" refers to the highest level of the Open System
Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).
This is not to say that HL7 conforms specifically to ISO defined elements of
the OSI's seventh level.  Also HL7 does not specify a set of ISO approved
specifications to occupy layers 1 to 6 under HL7's abstract message
specifications.  HL7 does, however, conform to the conceptual definition of an
application-to-application interface placed in the seventh layer of the OSI
model.<br>
In the OSI conceptual model, the functions of both communications software and
hardware are separated into seven layers, or levels.  The HL7 Standard is
primarily focused on the issues that occur within the seventh, or application,
level.  These are the definitions of the data to be exchanged, the timing of
the exchanges, and the communication of certain application specific errors
between the applications.  However, of necessity, protocols that refer to the
lower layers of the OSI model are sometimes mentioned to help implementors
understand the context of the Standard.  They are also sometimes specified to
assist implementors in establishing working HL7-based systems.<br>
The HL7 Working Group is composed of volunteers who give their time on a
personal basis or under sponsorship of their employers.  Membership in the HL7
Working Group has been, and continues to be, open to anyone wishing to
contribute to the development and refinement of  Level 7 Interface Standard for
network technology in healthcare.<br>
The Standard currently addresses the interfaces among various systems that send
or receive patient admissions/registration, discharge or transfer (ADT) data,
queries, orders, results, clinical observations, billing, and master file
update information.  <b>It does not try to assume a particular architecture
with respect to the placement of data within applications but is designed to
support a central patient care system as well as more distributed environment
where data resides in departmental systems.</b><br>
If we consider the multitude of healthcare information systems applications as
well as the variety of environments in which healthcare is delivered, it is
evident that there are many more interfaces which could benefit from
standardization.  The interfaces chosen were considered to be of high priority
by the members participating in the standards writing process.  HL7's intent is
to prepare a complete standard for these interfaces, built on a generic
framework that is sufficiently robust to support many other interfaces.  This
Standard has been put into production and is being used as a basis for
extending the existing interface definitions and also adding other
definitions.<br>
It is expected that one result of publishing this specification will be the
recruitment of more Working Group members with special interest in some newer
and not yet fully specified areas.  Some of the areas that have already been
identified are:<br>
	a)	decision support<br>
	b)	nursing applications<br>
	c)	additional specific ancillary departments<br>
	d)	computerized medical records<br>
	e)	information needs associated with healthcare delivery systems outside of
the acute care setting.<br>
The above notwithstanding, the Working Group members feel that the interfaces
addressed here are sufficient to provide significant benefit to the healthcare
community.<br>
This document is structured as follows.  The balance of this chapter contains a
rationale for developing the Standard, the goals of the Standard, and issues
which have been considered by the Working Group pertaining to scope and
operational approach.  It is hoped that this will help the readers understand
the basis for decisions that have been made in developing the Standard.
Subsequent chapters specify, respectively:<br>
	a)	the overall structure for all interfaces including a generalized query
interface<br>
	b)	patient admission, discharge, transfer and registration<br>
	c)	order entry<br>
	d)	patient accounting (billing) systems<br>
	e)	clinical observation data, such as laboratory results, that are sent as
identifiable data elements (rather than display oriented text)<br>
	f)	A generalized interface for synchronizing common reference files (master
files).</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading4">1.3  NEED FOR A STANDARD </A></h2>

<p><br>
The organization and delivery of healthcare services is an
information-intensive effort.  It is generally accepted that the efficacy of
healthcare operations is greatly affected by the extent of automation of
information management functions.  Many believe that healthcare delivery
agencies that have not automated their information systems are not able to
compete effectively in the healthcare market of the 1990's.<br>
In the past two decades, healthcare institutions, and hospitals in particular,
have begun to automate aspects of their information management.  Initially,
such efforts have been geared towards reducing paper processing, improving cash
flow, and improving management decision making.  In later years a distinct
focus on streamlining and improving clinical and ancillary services has
evolved, including bedside (in hospitals and other inpatient environments) and
"patient-side" systems (in ambulatory settings).  Within the last few years,
interest has developed in integrating all information related to the delivery
of healthcare to a patient over his or her lifetime (i.e., an electronic
medical record).  It has also been envisioned that all or part of this
electronic medical record should be able to be communicated electronically
anywhere as needed.<br>
It is not uncommon today for the average hospital to have installed computer
systems for admission, discharge, and transfer; clinical laboratories;
radiology; billing and accounts receivable, to cite a few.  Often these
applications have been developed by different vendors or in-house groups, with
each product having highly specific information formats.  As hospitals have
gradually expanded information management operations, a concomitant need to
share critical data among the systems has emerged.  Comprehensive systems that
aim at performing most, if not all, healthcare information management are in
production by selected vendors.  These systems may be designed in a centralized
or a distributed architecture.  Nevertheless, to the extent that such systems
are truly complete, their use would mitigate the need for an external data
interchange standard such as HL7.<br>
There are, however, many pressures on an institution to develop or acquire
individual departmental applications on a modular basis.  One source of such
pressure is the special departmental needs that may not be addressed well (or
perhaps at all) by a comprehensive vendor (i.e., so called "best-of-breed").
Another is the need to evolve the overall systems environment of a hospital
through a series of incremental, departmental decisions rather than in a
single, revolutionary acquisition.  These pressures could be met by an
environment containing a comprehensive system supplemented by departmental
systems, or one consisting entirely of separate and discrete systems.<br>
Network technology has emerged as a viable and cost-effective approach to the
integration of functionally and technically diverse computer applications in
healthcare environments.  However, these applications have developed due to
market structure rather than through a logical systems approach, they are
therefore often ad-hoc and idiosyncratic.  Extensive site-specific programming
and program maintenance are often necessary for interfacing these applications
in a network environment.  This occurs at considerable expense to the
user/purchaser while often keeping vendor staff from other initiatives such as
new product development.  The need for extensive site-specific interface work
could be greatly reduced if a standard for network interfaces for healthcare
environments were available and accepted by vendors and users alike.<br>
In summary, it is important that both vendors and users not be faced with the
problem of supporting incompatible transaction/communications structures.
Instead, a framework must be developed for minimizing incompatibility and
maximizing the exchange of information between systems.  It is proposed that
HL7 can act as a superstructure in this environment to facilitate a common
specification and specifications methodology.  It is indeed both practical and
economical to develop, and commit to, standard interfaces for computer
applications in healthcare institutions. </p>
<h2>
</h2>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">1.4  GOALS OF THE STANDARD </A></h2>

<p><br>
The specifications of this Standard were developed in accordance with
<b>apriori</b> specified goals.  Future extensions of the Standard should also
support these goals.<br>
HL7's purpose is to facilitate communication in healthcare settings.  The
<b>primary goal</b> is to provide standards for the exchange of data among
healthcare computer applications that eliminates or substantially reduces the
custom interface programming and program maintenance that may otherwise be
required.  This primary goal can be delineated as a set of goals:<br>
	a)	the Standard should support exchanges among systems implemented in the
widest variety of technical environments.  Its implementation should be
practical in a wide variety of programming languages and operating systems.  It
should also support communications in a wide variety of communications
environments, ranging from a full, OSI-compliant, 7-level network "stack" to
less complete environments including primitive point-to-point RS-232C
interconnections and transfer of data by batch media such as floppy disk and
tape.<br>
	b)	immediate transfer of single transactions should be supported along with
file transfers of multiple transactions<br>
	c)	the greatest possible degree of standardization should be achieved,
consistent with site variations in the usage and format of certain data
elements.  The Standard should accommodate necessary site-specific variations.
This will include, at least, site specific tables, code definitions and
possibly site specific message segments (i.e., HL7 Z segments).<br>
	d)	the Standard must support evolutionary growth as new requirements are
recognized.  This includes support of the process of introducing extensions and
new releases into existing operational environments.<br>
	e)	the Standard should be built upon the experience of existing production
protocols and accepted industry-wide standard protocols.  It should not,
however, favor the proprietary interests of specific companies to the detriment
of other users of the Standard.  At the same time, HL7 seeks to preserve the
unique attributes that an individual vendor can bring to the marketplace.<br>
	f)	while it is both useful and pertinent to focus on information systems
within hospitals, the long-term goal should be to define formats and protocols
for computer applications in all healthcare environments.<br>
	g)	the very nature of the diverse business processes that exist within the
healthcare delivery system prevents the development of either a universal
process or data model to support a definition of HL7's target environments.  In
addition, HL7 does not make a priori assumptions about the architecture of
healthcare information systems nor does it attempt to resolve architectural
differences between healthcare information systems. <b> For at least these
reasons, HL7 cannot be a true "plug and play" interface standard.</b>  These
differences at HL7 sites will probably require site negotiated agreements.<br>
	h)	a primary interest of the HL7 Working Group has been to employ the Standard
as soon as possible.  Having achieved this, HL7 has also developed an
infrastructure that supports a consensus balloting process and has applied to
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to be recognized as an
Accredited Standards Organization (ASO).<br>
	i)	cooperation with other related healthcare standards efforts (e.g., ACR/NEMA
DICOM, ASC X12, ASTM, IEEE/MEDIX, NCPDP, etc.) has become a priority activity
of HL7.  HL7 has participated in the ANSI HISPP (Health Information Systems
Planning Panel) process since its inception in 1992.</p>
<h2>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">1.5 HISTORY OF HL7 DEVELOPMENT</A></h2>

<p><br>
The HL7 Working Group has met approximately every 3-4 months since March 1987
to develop and review this specification.  The group is structured into
committees to address each of the functional interfaces under development, with
additional committees to address the overall control structure and various
administrative aspects of the group.  These committees have the responsibility
to author and maintain the chapters in the HL7 Interface Standard.  In
addition, from time to time various special interest groups are formed within
HL7 to develop ideas and sponsor particular perspectives that are not covered
by any single existing committee.  If a special interest group's activities
warrant and a new chapter is considered necessary, they may petition the HL7
Technical Committee Chair and the Executive Committee to form a Technical
Committee.<br>
In the initial three meetings, a version 1.0 draft Standard was prepared
covering the overall structure of the interfaces, ADT, order entry, and
display-oriented queries.  Although the patient accounting system was
recognized as very important, the time frame did not allow it to be addressed
in the first draft.  This draft was presented to a Plenary meeting of the
overall group in Tyson's Corner, VA on October 8, 1987. <br>
Version 2.0 was prepared subsequent to Plenary I in Tyson's Corner and
presented at Plenary II in Tucson in September 1988.  Since Plenary II, editing
and revisions for Version 2.1 and then 2.2 have been ongoing.  Since then the
Working Group has grown to nearly 300 individuals, far exceeding its original
size of 12 and the following has been accomplished:<br>
	a)	specifications for the various functional areas have been refined and
expanded<br>
	b)	formal liaison was developed with several other standards efforts: the ANSI
HISPP (Healthcare Information Standards Planning Panel) for the coordination of
healthcare standards efforts, the ASC X12N group for external EDI Standards,
the ASTM E31.11 group for Clinical Data Exchange Standards, the ACR/NEMA DICOM
group for standards relating to imaging and other aspects of Radiology
Information Systems, and the IEEE P1157 group for medical data interchange
("MEDIX").<br>
	c)	the generic control structure was modified, on the basis of comments, to be
adaptable to a wider variety of communications environments and to facilitate
cooperation with other standards groups<br>
	d)	a chapter on the interface to a patient accounting system has been added<br>
	e)	a chapter on the reporting of ancillary results has been prepared, based on
the ASTM 1238-88 Standard and with the direct, active participation of members
of the ASTM E31.11 committee<br>
	f)	a computerized data dictionary of all data elements and other message
components has been created.  Those portions of this document that contain
detailed listings of data were generated directly from that dictionary.
Appendix A contains cross references and other information generated from this
electronic data dictionary.<br>
	g)	inconsistencies and mistakes where discovered in the version 2.0 and 2.1
Standard.  These have been addressed and documented in version 2.2.<br>
	h)	extensive additions have occurred in the Order/Entry and Clinical
Observations Chapters to include data element oriented results, pharmacy orders
and administrations interface.<br>
	i)	message acknowledgments have been extended to include a separate enhanced
mode that defines the "accept acknowledgment."  While this mode of
acknowledgment has always been allowed, it is now obvious how HL7 supports any
environment when intermediaries exist in the network with implicit time delays
(such as store and forward services, "Interface Engines" that perform fan out
services, etc.).  Immediate acknowledgments are available to release the
sending system from the need to resend the message.<br>
	j)	distinctions have been documented between the HL7 abstract message
definition which is purely a level 7 (application level) definition vs. the HL7
encoding rules for converting an abstract message into a string of characters
that comprise an actual message.  These encoding rules are actually a suggested
potential alternative where a fully defined level 6 (presentation level)
definition does not exist (e.g., ISO's ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER)).</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading7">1.6  OVERVIEW </A></h2>

<p><br>
This section contains a description of the conceptual basis of the HL7
Standard, the approach to accommodating intra-site variations and evolutionary
changes, and the way it has been structured in order to accommodate varying
current and future communications environments.</p>
<h3>
</h3>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading8">1.6.1  HL7 encoding rules  </A></h3>

<p><br>
	Message formats prescribed in the HL7 encoding rules consist of data fields
that are of variable length and separated by a field separator character.
Rules describe how the various data types are encoded within a field and when
an individual field may be repeated.  The data fields are combined into logical
groupings called segments.  Segments are separated by segment separator
characters.  Each segment begins with a three-character literal value that
identifies it within a message.  Segments may be defined as required or
optional and may be permitted to repeat.  Individual data fields are found in
the message by their position within their associated segments.<br>
	All data is represented as displayable ASCII characters (hexadecimal values
between 20 and 7E, inclusive). All the special separators and other special
characters are also displayable ASCII characters, except that the segment
separator is the ASCII Carriage Return character.<br>
	The encoding rules distinguish between data fields that have the null value
and those that are not present.  The former are represented by two adjacent
quotation marks, the latter by no data at all (i.e., two consecutive separator
characters.)  The distinction between null values and those that are not
present is important when a record is being updated.  In the former case the
field in the database should be set to null; in the latter case it should
retain its prior value.  The encoding rules specify that if a receiving
application cannot deal with a data field not being present, it should treat
the data field as present but null.<br>
	The encoding rules specify that a receiving application should ignore fields
that are present in the message but were not expected rather than treat such a
circumstance as an error.</p>
<h3>
</h3>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading9">1.6.2  Local variations </A></h3>

<p><br>
	The HL7 Standard is intended to standardize data interchanges, not the
underlying applications systems.  This means that there will be a wide variety
in the manner in which the Standard are applied in different institutions.<br>
	The requirement to support diversity within the Standard is addressed in these
ways:<br>
	a)	The only data fields that are required in the abstract messages are those
necessary to support the logic of the relationships among the messages or their
basic purpose.  Many other fields are specified but made optional.<br>
	b)	There are provisions within the specifications to add messages or portions
of messages that are local to an institution. The conventions used for this are
intended to prevent conflict with future versions of the specification.</p>
<h3>
</h3>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading10">1.6.3  Evolutionary changes to the standards </A></h3>

<p><br>
	All standards must evolve as the applications they support change and as a
result of experience using them.  In recognition of this, the Standard includes
a protocol version ID in all messages.<br>
	New transactions or data elements will be added to operational HL7
environments as a result of changes in the Standard or due to changes in the
local implementation as permitted within the Standard.  It is important that
these changes be implementable at a site without requiring all communicating
applications to upgrade simultaneously.  The special provisions in the Encoding
Rules for dealing with fields that are not present or unexpected are very
important here.  Because of them, new fields can be added first to the sending
or source system; the receiving system will ignore the new fields until it has
been updated to use them.  Often, these rules also facilitate changing the
receiving system first.  Until the sending system is changed, the receiving
system will find the new data field 'not present' and deal with this according
to its rules for data not present.<br>
	Similarly, the HL7 Encoding Rules support changes in data field sizes.  Fields
are found within the message by examining separators, rather than by an offset.
Changing the size of a field does not change the procedure used to detect
subsequent fields.</p>
<h3>
</h3>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading11">1.6.4  Applicability to file transfers (batch processing) </A></h3>

<p><br>
	Although the HL7 Standard is defined in terms of the client-server (remote
operation) model, its standards are equally applicable to file transfers.  One
or more messages may be encoded according to the Encoding Rules, grouped in a
file and transferred using external media, FTAM, FTP, Kermit, or any other file
transfer protocol.  Responses may be grouped in a file and similarly
transmitted.  Chapter 2 provides the general mechanisms for the batch
transmittal of HL7 messages.</p>
<h3>
</h3>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading12">1.6.5  Relationship to other protocols </A></h3>

<p><br>
	A great deal of consideration has been given to the relationship between the
HL7 Standard protocol and other protocols.  There are three questions:<br>
	a)	what is the relationship between the HL7 protocol and "lower layer",
service protocols?  In strict accordance with the ISO OSI model, HL7 should not
replicate features of these protocols.  This can even be construed to require
HL7 to avoid replicating certain ISO layer 7 functionality contained in the
Service Elements.<br>
		However, it is the goal of the HL7 group to support healthcare communications
in a wide variety of communications environments, including many that are not
as complete as ISO will be one day.<br>
	b)	what is the relationship between the HL7 Standard protocol and other
applications protocols?  Protocols of interest include the ASC X12 Standards
for Electronic Document Interchange, the ASTM 1238-88 Standards for laboratory
data reporting, the ACR/NEMA DICOM Standards for imaging and other aspects of
Radiology Information Systems, and the IEEE P1157 Standards for medical data
interchange ("MEDIX").<br>
	c)	what is the relationship between the HL7 Standard and various proprietary
healthcare protocols in use today?</p>

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading13">1.6.5.1  Lower layer protocols</A></h4>

<p><br>
	The HL7 Encoding Rules are substantially different from the ASN.1 Basic
Encoding Rules (BER) documented in CCITT X.409 and X.209 and ISO 8825 or those
employed in LU6.2 or RPC.  This is because:<br>
	a)	by definition, the HL7 encoding rules will be applied where the environment
does not include software to do encoding.  Without such software, the burden on
applications programmers to develop messaging software that conforms to those
encoding rules is onerous.<br>
	b)	the encoding rules of these protocols depend on the assumption that lower
level protocols provide transparency (i.e., all character codes can be
transmitted without being changed by and of the lower levels).  This assumption
is often not met in the communications environments that must serve HL7 for the
interim.  The techniques that might be used to implement transparency in the
Lower Level Protocol are difficult to implement in some present-day
applications environments.<br>
	The notation chosen to document the message formats in the HL7 Standard is not
the Abstract Syntax Notation1 (ASN.1) Basic Encoding Rules (BER) used by ISO
and MEDIX.  This is because the ASN.1 language is so rich, and the HL7 message
format so simple, that when HL7 messages are defined using ASN.1, the result is
very repetitious and difficult to read. This is distracting and difficult to
explain to application programmers who are neither schooled in recursive
languages in general nor ASN.1 in particular.<br>
	Contrary to other high level communications environments, there is no notion
of association separate from the sending of the message from client to server
and the response.  This seems appropriate to the client-server model.<br>
	Whenever HL7 is applied in a networking environment, addressing will be an
issue.  This is equally true when it is applied on ISO Standards networks or
proprietary networks.  Although the Standard does not specify how this
addressing will occur, they do provide certain data fields that will be of
value in determining addresses.  The fields, Receiving Application, Receiving
Facility, and Processing ID, are located in the header of all HL7 messages.
Receiving Facility is intended for environments where multiple occurrences of
the same application are being run on the same computer system or on the same
network on behalf of different institutions or other organizational entities.
Processing ID is used where various versions of essentially the same
application may reside on the same computer for different purposes.  The
recommended values for the field are Production, Training, and Debugging.<br>
	The HL7 committee does not standardize the values for the Receiving
Application and Receiving fields, since the code sets chosen for them will be
tightly coupled to the overall architecture of applications within an
institution.  For applicability under the ISO Association Control Service
Element, these values will have to be registered as ISO Service Access Points.</p>

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading14">1.6.5.2 Other applications protocols</A></h4>

<p><br>
	The Working Group has given considerable attention to the relationship of the
HL7 protocol and other protocols.  A considerable liaison effort is underway.
This is described below:<br>
	a)	<u>ACR/NEMA DICOM.</u>  The HL7 Working Group maintains an on-going liaison
with the ACR/NEMA DICOM working group.  HL7 and ACR/NEMA DICOM are both members
of ANSI's HISPP MSDS.<br>
	b)	<u>ASC X12 Standards for Electronic Document Interchange.</u>  X12 is a
family of Standards that provide both general and specific descriptions for
data interchange within a number of industries.  The HL7 Encoding Rules are
modeled on the X12 Standards, although there are differences.  The HL7 Standard
needs to accommodate on-line exchange of individual transactions on LANs.  This
difference, and certain applications issues, are responsible for the variance
from X12.  X12 has recently decided to follow the UN/EDIFACT encoding rules for
all X12 standards produced in 1995 or later.  However, at this time, this
decision will not require retroactive maintenance activity on all existing X12
Standards Transaction Sets.<br>
		X12N transactions that facilitate the transfer of healthcare claims and
remittance information as well as benefit coordination, enrollment and
verification are enjoying dramatically increased use.  HL7 has elected to
assume that all business transactions between institutions regarding the
interchange of claims, benefits or other financial information are the
responsibility of ASC X12N, the insurance subcommittee of X12.  HL7 and ASC
X12N are both members of ANSI's HISPP Messaging Standards Developers
Subcommittee.<br>
		In February of 1994, HL7 and X12 signed an agreement to "improve coordination
efforts and have identified that technical issues must be harmonized.  Both
groups agree to migrate to the appropriate level of resolution of potentially
overlapping work by utilizing user and standards communities' and anticipated
health care reform requirements."<br>
		Since then, HL7 and X12 have created two bodies to address the goals of
harmonization: (1) HL7 - X12N Corrdinating Ad Hoc Steering Committee to oversee
efforts, and (2) HL7 - X12N Joint Coordinating Committee to develop and
implement specific plans to achieve harmonization.  Both committees have
convened a meeting in 1994 and will continue their work through 1995.<br>
	c)	<u>ASTM 1238.88 Laboratory Data Reporting.</u>  An active liaison effort
between the ASTM committee and the Working group has resulted in minor changes
in the ASTM specification to enhance compatibility, changes in the HL7 control
specifications to enhance compatibility, and the development of the entire
Ancillary Data Reporting chapter, developed jointly by the committees and built
on the ASTM Standards.  This liaison has now extended to the point where both
groups now have the permission to freely use the contents of each others
standards efforts "in whole" within their own published Standards.<br>
		Some distinctions are more in the terminology chosen than the actual message
content.  For example, the ASTM "sub-field delimiter" is generally used to
separate repetitions of homogenous values.  It is called a "repetition
separator" in HL7.  HL7 and ASTM are both members of ANSI's HISPP MSDS.<br>
	(d)	<u>IEEE P1157 ("MEDIX").</u>  The MEDIX committee is defining an
application level protocol similar in scope to HL7 but built strictly on the
ISO protocol stack up to and including the Remote Operation Service Element
(ROSE).  HL7 varies from this approach by the decision not to depend on ROSE
nor use the ASN.1 BER syntax notation.  Despite the difference in approaches,
the HL7 Working Group has regular liaison with the MEDIX committee.  The
Working Group has devised a format for the HL7 Standard that is relatively
independent of the encoding rules chosen and easily translated into the ASN.1
notation.  The transactions defined in this manner should be directly
transferable to the MEDIX effort, and transaction messages encoded using the
HL7 scheme should be translatable to transactions encoded using the BER.  This
should facilitate the creation of gateways between the HL7 and future
environments.<br>
		In addition, HL7 and MEDIX have agreed on a course for convergence.  This
will occur within the HL7 Abstract Message definitions.  MEDIX has further
agreed to use the HL7 abstract message definitions as defined in V2.1 as a
starting point for the MEDIX message definitions. HL7 and MEDIX are both
members of ANSI's HISPP MSDS.</p>
