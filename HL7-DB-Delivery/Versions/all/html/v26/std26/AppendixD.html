Abstract Message
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The basic level of definition within HL7 is that of the abstract message associated with a particular trigger event.  The abstract message definition includes the data fields that will be sent within a message, the valid response messages, and the treatment of application level errors or the failure of the underlying communications system.  An HL7 abstract message is defined in terms of HL7 segments and fields, as described in Section 2.4.8.

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
ASN.1 is a data definition language that allows formal definitions of information structures to be expressed in a manner that is independent of any implementation constraints.  It may be used to create complex hierarchical structures from basic primitive types.

Acknowledgment - Accept Level
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The receiving system commits the message to safe storage in a manner that releases the sending system from any obligation to resend the message.  A response is returned to the initiator indicating successful receipt and secure storage of the information.

ACR/NEMA
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
American College of Radiology and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.  The American College of Radiology formed a relationship with the National Electronic Manufacturers' Association in 1982 to develop a standard for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM).  The purpose of the standard was to promote a generic digital image communication format; facilitate the development and expansion of picturing archiving and communication systems (PACS); allow the creation of diagnostic information databases for remote access; and help assure the usability of new equipment with existing systems.  The current standard (Version 3.0) defines image data as well as patient, study and visit information necessary to provide the context for the images.  Approval of this document as an American National Standard may be pursued in the future by NEMA, which is accredited by ANSI.

Assessment
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A type of observations/result or observations/result set performed by a health care provider on the patient.  An assessment represents a collection of data about the patient to evaluate a patient's current and ongoing condition.  An assessment can be subjective or objective; initial or ongoing; clinical or non-clinical; formal or informal.  Examples of assessment components include height and weight, body systems, I&O, and activities of daily living.  Standards (e.g., Gordon's Functional Health Pattern) and rules are used to prepare an assessment.

<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A status in which a document or entry has been signed manually or electronically by one or more individuals who attest to its accuracy.  No explicit determination is made that the assigned individual has performed the authentication.  While the standard allows multiple instances of authentication, it would be typical to have a single instance of authentication, usually by the assigned individual.

Auxiliary Application
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
An auxiliary application neither exerts control over, nor requests changes to a schedule.  It is only concerned with gathering information about a particular schedule.  It can be considered an "interested third-party," in that it is interested in any changes to a particular schedule, but has no interest in changing it or controlling it in any way.  It may gather information passively or actively.  An auxiliary application passively collects information by receiving unsolicited updates from a filler application.

Causal Relationship 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
When an event occurs a product may be suspected as causing the event but rarely can it be proven particularly at an early stage of the product's life.  Certain information about the relationship between the product and the event can reinforce the belief in a causal relationship between the product and the event while others can decrease the probability that there is a causal relationship.

Child Appointment
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A child appointment is an appointment subordinate to another appointment (called a parent appointment).  For example, a single instance of an appointment in a group of recurring appointments is a child to the group.  Child appointments can themselves be parent appointments.  For example, if a battery of appointments is scheduled, then the atomic units of the battery are children to the battery request.  If the battery is scheduled as a repeating appointment, then each instance of the battery of appointments (parent to each of the atomic units) is a child to the original repeating request.

<p>
A clinical pathway is a standardized plan of care against which progress towards health is measured.  A clinical pathway is applied based upon the results of a patient assessment.  A clinical pathway shows exact timing of all key patient care activities intended to achieve expected standard outcomes within designated time frames.  A clinical pathway includes documentation of problems, expected outcomes/goals, and clinical interventions/orders.

Clinical Trial 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A scientifically rigorous study of individual outcomes to some process of healthcare intervention.   Clinical trials usually involve medical treatments so this document will use the term treatment, rather than the broader term intervention.  A clinical trial design may randomly assign and compare one treatment approach with another, or generate safety and efficacy data on a single treatment approach.  The clinical trial has a protocol for the patient's course of treatment and/or evaluation.  There is usually a schedule for collection of data to measure compliance, safety, and outcomes.

Component Separator
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The component separator is used to separate adjacent components of some data fields.  Its use is described in the descriptions of the relevant data fields.  The character that represents the component separator is specified for each message as the first character in the Encoding Characters data field of the MSH segment.  Absent other considerations it is recommended that all sending applications use  ` Ë? ' as the component separator.  However, all applications are required to accept whatever character is included in the Message Header and use it to parse the message.

Data Schedule
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The treatment, diagnostic, and procedural requirements, as well as data collection due dates, scheduled on a timeline for most clinical trials.  As data are reported, they may need to reflect the scheduled time point that they satisfy.  Clinical trials quality control requires attention to compliance between the protocol's schedule and patient data records.
</p>
<p>
The data schedule will be keyed by time points relative to the study.  Some data may be due prior to and at the conclusion of the study and/or one or more of its phases.  Some are interim within the study or its phases depending on protocol events such as administration of treatment, arbitrary time intervals instated to make and record assessments, or some clinical milestone such as relapse of disease.  Often, multiple data parameters are scheduled at the same time point.  Several examples follow.

Encoding Rules
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
To determine the exact representation of an abstract message, one applies the HL7 encoding rules defined in Chapter 2 to the abstract definition from the relevant transaction definition chapter.  This level corresponds most closely to ISO layers 5 and 6.  In effect, the encoding rules support an established session for each message and its reply.

Escape Character

</TABLECELL>
<p>
In text fields (Type TX or FT) another special character is allowed, the escape character.  Any character allowed in a TX or FT field may serve as the escape character.  The single character that represents the escape character is specified differently for each message as the third character in the Encoding Characters data field of the MSH segment.  This field is optional.  Applications that do not need to use an escape character may omit this character.  Absent other considerations it is recommended that all sending applications use '\' as the escape character.  However, all applications are required to accept whatever character is included in this field and use it to parse text fields within the message.

Expected Adverse Product Reaction 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
Expected events are those which prior experience has demonstrated to be probabilistically linked to the product and are generally included in product labeling.
</p>
<p>
Pre-marketing: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational product).
</p>
<p>
Post-marketing/US (current): Unexpected means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.
</p>
<p>
Post-marketing/US (proposed): The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should e listed for the drug in all countries where the drug is marketed.  It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this post-marketing periodic report.
</p>
<p>
Post-marketing/European Union: This relates to an adverse reaction which is not mentioned in any ECsummary of product characteristics (SPC).  In the absence of any European SPC, an international document prepared by the marketing authorization holder containing all relevant safety information which the marketing authorization holder considers should be listed for the medicinal product in all countries where the medicinal product is marketed (Care Data Sheet).
</p>
<p>
Post-marketing/WHO: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labeling or market authorization, or expected from characteristics of the drug.

<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
Field Components 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A field entry may also have discernable parts or components.  For example, the patient's name is recorded as last name, first name, and middle initial, each of which is a distinct entity separated by a component delimiter (sub-subfield in astm e1238-94).

<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
Field Separator
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The HL7 field separator separates two adjacent data fields within an HL7 segment.  It also separates the segment ID from the first data field in the segment.  The value that represents the field separator may be defined differently for each message.  Whatever character is the fourth character of the MSH segment serves as the field separator for all segments in the message.  Absent other considerations, it is recommended that all sending applications use "|" as the field separator.  However, all receiving applications are required to accept whatever character is included in this position and use it to parse the message.

Filler
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The application responding to, i.e., performing, a request for services (orders) or producing an observation.  The fill can also originate requests for services (new orders), add additional services to existing orders, replace existing orders, put an order on hold, discontinue an order, release a held order, or cancel existing orders.  Referred to as Producer in ASTM terminology.

Filler 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
**Person, or service, which produces the observations (fills the order) requested by the requestor.  The word is synonymous with "producer" and includes diagnostic services and clinical services and care providers who report observations about their patients.  The clinical laboratory is a producer of lab test results (filler of a lab order), the nursing service is the producer of vital signs observations (the filler of orders to measure vital signs), and so on.

Filler Application
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The filler application role in the scheduling model is very similar to the filler application concept presented in Chapter 4, Order Entry.  A filler application, in the scheduling model, is one that "owns" one or more schedules for one or more services or resources.  It fulfills requests to book slots for the services or resources over which it exerts control.  It also notifies other applications of activity related to appointments, such as new bookings, modifications, cancellations, etc.

IEEE P1157 Medical Data Interchange (MEDIX) Committee.  MEDIX was organized in 1987 to draft a standard for the exchange of data between hospital computer systems.  The MEDIX committee is committed to developing a standard set of hospital system interface transactions based on the ISO standards for all seven layers of the OSI reference model.  The committee proposes to use the ASN.1 standard to specify message content as well as encode standard messages.  IEEE is also developing the standard medical information bus (MIB; IEEE P1073) for communicating among critical care devices and computers.

Level Seven
</p>
<TABLECELL>

<p>
Level Seven refers to the highest level of International Standards Organizations (ISO) communications model for Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)-the application level.  Issues within the application level include definition of the data to be exchanged, the timing of the interchange, and communication of certain errors to the application.
</p>
<p>
The seventh level supports such functions as security checks, identification of the participants, availability checks, negotiating exchange mechanisms and, most importantly, structuring the data exchanges themselves.

Message
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A message is the atomic unit of data transferred between systems.  It is comprised of a group of segments in a defined sequence.  Each message has a message type that defines its purpose.  For example, the ADT Message type is used to transmit portions of a patient's ADT data from one system to another.  A three character code contained within each message identifies its type.

<p>
1. Physical Layer - concerned with the mechanical and electrical means by which devices are physically connected and data is transmitted.
</p>
<p>
2. Link Layer - concerned with moving data reliably across the physical data link.
</p>
<p>
3. Network Layer - provides the means to establish, maintain and terminate connections between systems; concerned with information switching and routing.
</p>
<p>
4. Transport Layer - concerned with end-to-end data integrity and quality of service.
</p>
<p>
5. Session Layer - standardizes the task of setting up and terminating a session; it coordinates interaction between end application processes.
</p>
<p>
6. Presentation Layer - relates to the character set and data code used, and to the way data is displayed on a screen or printer.
</p>
<p>
7. Application Layer - concerned with the higher-level functions that provide support to the application or system activities.

Pharmacy Order Messages
</p>
<TABLECELL>

Phase of a Clinical Trial
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The phase structure serves several purposes in the clinical trials messages.  Other computer systems may need to know that the patient has begun a phase with a particular treatment regimen or diagnostic schedule, such as the pharmacy or order entry systems.  When reporting study data, observations and variables often describe particular phase instances.  For example, each course of treatment may have its own values for the same set of observations or variables.  Phase instances may also have distinct data schedules that need to be linked to submitted data.

Placer 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
**Person or service that requests (places order for) an observation battery, e.g., the physician, the practice, clinic, or ward service, that orders a lab test, x-ray, vital signs, etc.  The meaning is synonymous with, and used interchangeably with, requestor.

Placer Application
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The role of the placer application in the scheduling model is also very similar to its counterpart in the Order Entry chapter.  A placer application must request the booking, modification, cancellation, etc., of an appointment for a service or resource because it cannot exert any control over that service or resource on the schedule.  In requesting that these appointments be booked or modified in some way, the placer application is asking the filler application to exert its control over the schedule on the placer application's behalf.

<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A problem of a given individual can be described by formal diagnosis coding systems (such as DRGs, NANDA Nursing Diagnosis, ICD9, DSM, etc.) or by other professional descriptions of health care issues affecting an individual.  Problems can be short or long term in nature, chronic or acute, and have a status.  In a longitudinal record, all problems may be of importance in the overall long term care of an individual, and may undergo changes in status repeatedly.  Problems are identified during patient visits, and may span multiple visits, encounters, or episodes of care.

Querying Application
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A querying application neither exerts control over, nor requests changes to a schedule.  Rather than accepting unsolicited information about schedules, as does an auxiliary application, the querying application actively solicits this information using a query mechanism.  It will be driven by a person wanting information about schedules, and may be part of an application filling the placer application role as defined in this chapter.  The information that the querying application receives is valid only at the exact time that the query results are generated by the filler application.  Changes made to the schedule after the query results have been returned are not communicated to the querying application until it issues another query transaction.

</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The repetition separator is used in some data fields to separate multiple occurrences of a field.  It is used only where specifically authorized in the descriptions of the relevant data fields.  The character that represents the repetition separator is specified for each message as the second character in the Encoding Characters data field of the MSH segment.  Absent other considerations it is recommended that all sending applications use "~" as the repetition separator.  However, all applications are required to accept whatever character is included in the Message Header and use it to parse the message.

Segment
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
An HL7 segment is a logical grouping of data fields.  Segments of a message may be required or optional.  They may occur only once in a message or they may be allowed to repeat.  Each segment is identified by a unique three character code known as the Segment ID.
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
Segment (Record)
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
A typed aggregate of fields (fields) describing one complete aspect of a message.  For example, the information about one order is sent as type of segment (OBR), the information related to an observation is sent as another segment (OBX).
</p>
<p>
The segment in a message is analogous to a record in a database, and in previous versions of the standard we used record in place of the word segment.  We have changed the nomenclature to be consistent with HL7 and other standards organizations in this version.

Sequence Number Protocol
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
An extension to the basic HL7 message protocol used for certain types of data transactions between systems where the issue of keeping the data bases synchronized is critical.  Although the sequence number protocol is limited to the use of sequence numbers on a single transaction stream between two applications, this sequencing protocol is sufficiently robust to allow the design of HL7-compatible store-and-forward applications.

Serious Adverse Product Reaction 
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
An adverse product reaction which:
</p>
<p>
is fatal (results in death)
</p>
<p>
is life threatening
</p>
<p>
requires hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization
</p>
<p>
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
</p>
<p>
results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
</p>
<p>
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also be considered serious.

<p>
A slot is one unit on a schedule.  A slot represents the smallest unit of time or quantity that a service or resource may be booked.  Depending on the nature of the service or resource, there may be more than one defined slot at a given instant of time.  For example, if a service is an open group therapy session with twelve available seats, then there are twelve slots for the given block of time.

Subcomponent Separator
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The subcomponent separator is used to separate adjacent subcomponents of some data fields.  Its use is described in the descriptions of the relevant data fields.  The character that represents the subcomponent separator is specified for each message as the fourth character in the Encoding Characters data field of the MSH segment.  Absent other considerations it is recommended that all sending applications use "&" as the subcomponent separator.   However, all applications are required to accept whatever character is included in the Message Header and use it to parse the message.

Trigger Event
</p>
<TABLECELL>
</TABLECELL>
<p>
The event that initiates an exchange of messages is called a trigger event.  The HL7 Standard is written from the assumption that an event in the real world of health care creates the need for data to flow among systems.  The real-world event is called the trigger event.  For example, the trigger event "a patient is admitted" may cause the need for data about that patient to be sent to a number of other systems.  There is a one-to-many relationship between message types and trigger event codes.  The same trigger event code may not be associated with more than one message type.
